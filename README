Simon Says Game

Can be deployed using HTML/CSS + JS in an editor. I use Atom.

Create four rounded sections within a centered grid to act
as the buttons of the simon game

On hitting "start", a function will randomly pick a # from 1-4,
each number corresponding to one of the four buttons. The
function will save that number in a list (iterating over this
list will function as the order in which the buttons should
be pressed)

The button will "light up" and play a noise. Then it is the player's
turn. If the player selects correctly, the game continues. Otherwise,
a "Sorry Try Again" message appears and the player must restart
